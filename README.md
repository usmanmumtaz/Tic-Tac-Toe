# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a tic-tac-toe game Single and Multiplayer written in C programming language.
I used "Cygwin" as output terminal.
You may experience some  issues in UI depending upon the output terminal you are using.
I wrote this code 2 years ago so now I am finding difficulty in adding comments in the code but I will add them as soon as I find some free time.
Right now I am uploading my whole code as it is.
As soon as I find some free time, I will divide my code in multiple commits.
Right now I am uploading it just to get started with GitHub.
.
If you are finding difficulty with getting started with my game, Read "How to play" in which I have provided instructions.
Happy Gaming.
